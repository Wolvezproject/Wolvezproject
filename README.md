**`Self Taught Developer`**

Coming from labor-intensive roles and evolving into a proficient Automation Technician, I knew I was meant for a different path. I was determined to break away from conventional paths to pursue a more impactful career. Despite nurturing the dream of becoming a developer since my high school days, it took time to summon the courage to embark on this transformative journey.

Currently, I am actively immersed in the process of becoming a full-stack developer and content creator documenting my struggles, methodically establishing my brand and visual identity through each project. From the inception of design to the resolution of challenges with code, every project reflects my commitment. Witness the ongoing development of a future Senior Developer.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Story</h3></summary>

"In 2017, I embarked on a self-taught coding journey amidst life's challenges, including personal losses. Faced with the need to provide for my family, I navigated away to various jobs for five years, always yearning for something more. After deciding to pursue my 2015 dream of studying Computer Science, I balanced work, family, and studying at home. While thriving as an Automation Technician, financial constraints persisted due to market trends and inflation. Motivated for change, I committed to becoming a software engineer. Enrolling in the ZTM - Zero to Mastery course, I dedicated over a year to studying and evolving from a coding newbie to future full-stack developer. This is just the beginning; my determination to achieve greatness as a senior software engineer is stronger than ever. Get ready, because here I come."
